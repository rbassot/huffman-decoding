# Huffman Encoding
SENG440 project by Daniel Kinahan and Raphael Bassot

# Details
This Huffman Encoding project utilizes:

- The French extended alphabet of symbols for input alphabet: 24 uppercase letters, 24 lowercase letters, 16 uppercase accented letters, 16 lowercase accented letters, and the SPACE character and `\n` character for a total of **82** symbols are allowed as input for the encoding.

- The probability table of the French alphabet letters is determined by their probability of occurrence in any text, on average. Below is the probability table used for the Huffman project, which is taken from research that analyzed a multi-genre text of 2,182,037 characters (Source: https://www.sttmedia.com/characterfrequency-french).
